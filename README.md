# Electronic-Voting-Machine

This project includes hardware design along with a software interface that has been uploaded here. Hardware prototype uses Arduino mega, fingerprint sensor, touch screen module, GSM modem, etc. A database is designed on a MYSQL server, which is used to store the fingerprint templates generated through the fingerprint module, voters' detailed information, a list of candidates for specific elections, and other necessary information. A wired connection using an ethernet shield and router is established for the database connection with Arduino. The user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and JQuery to access the data stored in the database and also to provide an integrated platform to the election authorities for central control.
